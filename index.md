I'm a 3rd year mechanical engineering major at California Polytechnic University. I enjoy studying fluid mechanics, and lately I've taken a interest in coding. 
Some of my favorite classes that I've taken that might be interesting are:
*   ME540 _Compressible Flow_
*   ME542 _Viscous Flow_
*   ME470 _Special Advanced Topics (Classical Fluid Mechanic Problems)_
*   ME418 _Mechanical Control Systems_
*   CSC101 _Python_

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

# FEA Simulation Projects

## Ansys Discovery + Fluent CFD Simulation

For my senior design project, we were interested with the in-cylinder flow of a diesel engine cylinder + piston system. Our group of 4 was interested in dimpling the piston crown surface in order to optimize the fuel/air mixture, therefore increasing efficiency and decreasing emissions. The unique in-cylinder flow characteristics were challenging as they would be impossible to experimentally model.
Here is a video of our preliminary CFD testing of the flow characteristics of a diesel piston system at the crank angle of top dead center. 


## Structural FEA Analysis (Solidworks)

For our design class, we constructed a scooter. It was first necessary to conduct preliminary analysis so we could spec the appropriate tube size and fastening materials.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
